## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Pure functions

So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

+ It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
+ It does not cause any observable side effects.
